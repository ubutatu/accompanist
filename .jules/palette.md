## 2024-05-22 - [Permission Samples UX]
**Learning:** Enhancing permission rationale screens with illustrative icons and specific action-oriented button labels (e.g., "Allow camera access" vs. "Request permission") improves user trust and clarity. Using `Arrangement.spacedBy` in `Column` ensures consistent visual rhythm without manual spacers.
**Action:** Use `Icons.Default.Face` for rationale prompts and `Icons.Default.Done` with success colors for granted states in Compose-based permission flows.

## 2024-06-12 - [Hierarchical Sample Navigation]
**Learning:** In sample apps with nested categories, static TopAppBar titles and missing back buttons disorient users. Contextual titles (last segment of path) and a standard back icon improve orientation and navigation flow.
**Action:** Use `Icons.AutoMirrored.Filled.ArrowBack` for back buttons and always add `Role.Button` to clickable list items for accessibility.
